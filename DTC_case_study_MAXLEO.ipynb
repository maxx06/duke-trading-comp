    "In an alternative reality, the era of continuous trading came to an abrupt end in the early 2010s in the aftermath of the Great Recession, replaced by a single daily auction that redefined global financial markets. The shift was not the product of a single event but rather the culmination of decades of discontent with the trajectory of modern finance. Public sentiment had turned against the financial industry, increasingly viewed as a system that prioritized speed and speculation over substance and societal contribution. Stories of brilliant minds dedicating their careers to shaving microseconds off trade execution times—rather than solving pressing global challenges—fueled a growing belief that finance had become a profound waste of human potential. This narrative gained traction in the public consciousness and became a rallying cry for reform.\n",
    "\n",
    "Behind the scenes, a quieter but equally consequential shift was taking place. Traditional stock exchanges, long the gatekeepers of market activity, found themselves losing ground to alternative trading venues like dark pools. Nearly half of all trading volume occurred in these opaque, off-exchange platforms, where institutional investors could transact large blocks of shares without moving the market. Frustrated by this erosion of their influence and revenue, exchanges began lobbying regulators for a radical restructuring of the market. Their argument was ostensibly about fairness and transparency, but critics noted that the proposed system of a single daily auction would concentrate trading volume—and fees—back into the exchanges’ hands. This alignment of public frustration and private lobbying created the conditions for sweeping change.\n",
    "\n",
    "The transition to the single auction system was implemented over a period of five years, during which market participants were forced to adapt to the new paradigm. Each day, orders could be submitted until a predetermined cutoff time, after which prices were set in a centralized auction. Exchanges marketed the system as a triumph of simplicity and fairness, claiming it would eliminate the chaos of continious trading and fragmentation. For the public, the promise of a less frenetic market resonated with a desire to see finance serve the broader economy rather than itself. However, many skeptics saw the reform as a power grab by exchanges, who now controlled the critical moment of price discovery.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the system took hold, its impact was profound. Liquidity during the rest of the day dried up; the absence of continuous trading reshaped the role of finance professionals, shifting emphasis from speed and execution to analysis and forecasting. While some hailed the changes as a return to fundamentals, others lamented the loss of opportunities for real-time price adjustments. Outside the financial sector, opinions were equally divided. Advocates pointed to the reduction in volatility and the restoration of trust in the markets, arguing that the auction system had lowered the cost of trading since there was no longer a bid-ask spread. Detractors, however, noted that the concentration of trading into a single moment increased systemic risks and sometimes resulted in large price swings. In hindsight, the move to single daily auctions was both a product of its time and a reflection of deeper societal shifts. It addressed many of the immediate concerns around market stability and transparency, yet it left lingering questions about the role of finance in the broader human endeavor. Whether it represented genuine progress or merely a consolidation of power remains a topic of debate among historians and economists."

    "The criteria for grading the competition—based on CAGR and Sharpe ratio—naturally extend into two fundamental concepts in finance: portfolio optimization and optimal leverage. These concepts are deeply intertwined with the metrics used and encourage contestants to think about broader principles beyond simple return maximization (which is still important).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Portfolio Optimization (Markowitz Framework)**\n",
    "The use of the Sharpe ratio as a grading metric directly connects to the principles of portfolio optimization, as introduced by Harry Markowitz. In this framework, the goal is to construct a portfolio that maximizes return for a given level of risk or minimizes risk for a given level of return. Contestants are implicitly incentivized to consider not only the predictive accuracy of their strategies but also how their allocations manage risk across the portfolio. For instance, while a highly concentrated allocation might yield a high return, it could expose the portfolio to extreme volatility, reducing the Sharpe ratio. By balancing allocations between assets like SPY, QQQ, DATAFC, and DATAFO—and even the cash component—participants are effectively engaging in a simplified form of Markowitz optimization, seeking to allocate weights in a way that optimally balances risk and reward.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Optimal Leverage (Kelly Criterion)**\n",
    "The inclusion of CAGR as a grading criterion introduces the concept of optimal leverage, as informed by the Kelly Criterion. CAGR measures the long-term growth rate of the portfolio, reflecting the compounding effect of returns over time. To maximize CAGR, contestants must carefully consider the level of leverage in their strategies. While higher leverage can amplify returns, it also increases volatility and the risk of drawdowns, which can severely impact the compounding process. The Kelly Criterion provides a theoretical framework for determining the optimal leverage that maximizes long-term growth while avoiding overexposure to risk. Contestants who understand and apply this principle can find the balance between aggressive and conservative leverage, ensuring their strategies are sustainable over the long run.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Grading for the case** will be based on two key metrics: **compound annual growth rate (CAGR) and Sharpe ratio over one year of out-of-sample (OOS) data.** CAGR evaluates the absolute monetary performance of the strategy, reflecting its ability to maximize returns. The Sharpe ratio measures risk-adjusted returns, highlighting strategies that effectively balance profitability with volatility. While these metrics emphasize different aspects of performance, it is possible for a strategy to excel in all both by achieving high returns with consistent risk management and sustainable growth. Participants are encouraged to design robust strategies that optimize across these dimensions for a comprehensive evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your final score in the data science case will be determined by the sum of your placements between CAGR rankings and Sharpe ratio rankings. For example, if your team places 7th in CAGR and 2nd in Sharpe Ratio out of the 35 teams, your score will be 9. Lowest score wins.\n",

    "The code below implements a grading function designed to evaluate trading algorithms based on historical data without allowing any \"look-ahead bias.\" Each day, the algorithm is provided with only the data available up to that point, ensuring fairness and adherence to real-world constraints. The function validates the contestant’s allocations against several rules: **allocations must sum to 1.0 and the sum of absolute values of positions cannot exceed 3 (to limit leverage).** It then calculates daily returns based on the provided weights and updates the portfolio's value. The key performance metrics final portfolio value and Sharpe ratio are computed to measure the effectiveness of the strategy. This same function will be applied to one year of out-of-sample (OOS) data to evaluate the robustness of the submitted algorithms under unseen market conditions. Please make sure that your submitted algorithm handles edge cases, such as the presence of only a single row at the beginning of the dataset. **Contestants are strongly encouraged to thoroughly test their code for bugs or violations of the constraints**, as submissions that fail to run correctly or violate the rules will be disqualified to ensure fairness for all participants."
